+Create the core logic for a mini app called “What can I cook with what I have?”.  
+
+Assumptions:
+
+1. The user selects which ingredients they currently have at home (a list of food items).  
+2. The app has a local database of simple, everyday recipes. Each recipe contains:  
+   - dish name  
+   - list of ingredients (with quantities and units)  
+   - short preparation description (maximum 5 steps)  
+   - estimated cooking time  
+   - difficulty level (easy/medium)  
+3. Based on the user’s ingredient list, choose recipes that:  
+   - can be made 100% with the available ingredients,  
+   - or need at most 1 missing ingredient (then clearly list that ingredient).  
+
+Your tasks:  
+- Propose a data structure (for example JSON) for a single recipe and for the user’s ingredient list.  
+- Based on an example user ingredient list, generate 10 sample recipes using this structure.  
+- Write an algorithm (in pseudocode or simple JavaScript/TypeScript) that:  
+  1) takes the user ingredient list and the recipe list as input,  
+  2) returns two lists:  
+     - “Recipes with all ingredients”,  
+     - “Recipes with one missing ingredient” (with the missing ingredient included in the result).  
+
+Answer concisely, without explanations outside of the code and data structures – first show the data structures, then the sample data, and finally the algorithm.
